This is a Java implementation of the AppFirst Collector API.

The collector API allows you to inject strings directly into the 
collector data stream. The strings are handled by the web application 
as incident reports. The number of incident reports can be included in 
various graphs and visualizations. The strings themselves are 
visible as detailed data by clicking on any point in a graph in the
web application. All incident reports are collected into a given minute 
in the time series visualizations.

The collector API uses POSIX message queues (% man 7 mq_overview) as
a message passing IPC to pass a message from your Java app to
the AppFirst collector. message queues are used as a common IPC
so that various client bindings can be supported, in addition to Java. 

Because POSIX message queues are used, the Java client code needs to
access native OS functions. We use JNA (http://jna.java.net/) for this.
The jna.jar file is used along with AfCollector.class.

This client binding is implemented as a log handler. All that is required is
to instantiate a handler and logging performed with standard Java log I/Fs
will cause formatted log strings to be placed in the collector data stream.

Build:
% ant
builds the classes and jars as needed

% ant -buildfile ./build_jar.xml
creates the AfCollector.jar combining classes from jna.jar & AfCollector.class

Run a test:
% java -jar bin/AfCollector.jar 200
creates 2 sample log messages that are placed in the collector data stream

The main method in the file src/AfCollectorLogHandler.java provides an 
example for using the log handler.

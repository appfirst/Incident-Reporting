Incident-Reporting
==================

Incident reports are similar to logs, with the exception that they are not written to files. The strings are written directly in the collector data stream. This creates less overhead and allows for efficient information exchange. It is important to note that incident reporting is not intended to replace logs. Rather these reports are intended to convey information about specific software situations. Incident reports become a tool to communicate specific software situations in an  operational context.
